## attempts to autofill input from
## password-store data in text fields
## based on the window title

## this script expects a directory in your
## password-store-dir called ".autofill"
## in this directory you will be prompted
## to create new files each time you encounter
## an unrecognized window title.
## simply add lines like this to the file:
## path: personal/somewebsite/whatever
## if there are more than one path, a
## gui will pop up and ask you to pick the
## right one.

## if the default pattern set here is not ideal
## for a particular website or app, set
## an entry pattern in either the autofill
## file or the password entry file itself.
## lines should look something like this:
## pattern: username tab password enter sleep3 pin enter
## all entries should be single words as the list is space
## separated. sleep times will be parsed.

set -e

## first of all, you must run this script
## with either the a or o argument
usage="usage: $0 <a|o> \n
  a autofill username and password according to pattern \n
  o capture and enter time-based otp"
